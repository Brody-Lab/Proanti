# Proanti
Code repository for the Duan, Pagan, Piet et al. manuscript


1) To regenerate the initial data files, run files in the folder "preparatory_code". The three files data_sc.mat , data_fof.mat and data_pfc.mat were too large and were not added to this repository. To download those, please run the script "step0_save_all_data_from_mysql.m" (needs Experport in the Matlab path)

2) To re-run all the classifier code, run files in "classifier_code"

3) To regenerate each of the Figures, run the corresponding script. For example, to regenerate Figure 1, run "Figure1.m"
